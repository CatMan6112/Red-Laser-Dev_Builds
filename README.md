# What Is Red Laser?

Red Laser is a multiplayer based battle royale FPS game built in Unity and built and developed with browser based play in mind. 

## Why is it in Alpha?
Red Laser is still very alpha. "Red Laser" is probably not going to be it's permanent name. But the idea of a multiplayer fps built for browser play will be the main focus. The reason Red Laser will be in alpha is because, lets be honest, I suck at C# and this is the **first** Cat-Nitro exclusive.

### when will it come out of alpha? :>
no clue dude.

## What's the actual gameplay?
This is still subject to change, but currently it will be a 20 player 1v1 battle royale. There will be 3 levels of guns that will be deeper inside the map. The goal is to be the first to get these better guns, by any means necessary.

## Is this school appropriate 🤓☝️?
yes, it's all laser guns, trust bro.
